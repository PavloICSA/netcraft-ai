# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds basic time series forecasting capabilities to NetCraft AI, allowing users to analyze temporal data patterns and make predictions about future values. The implementation will focus on common forecasting methods that can run entirely client-side, maintaining the application's core principle of no server dependencies. This feature will integrate seamlessly with the existing data upload and visualization infrastructure while providing educational transparency through TypeScript implementations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to upload time series data and automatically detect temporal patterns, so that I can quickly understand the underlying trends and seasonality in my dataset.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads CSV data with date/time columns THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and parse temporal columns
2. WHEN temporal data is detected THEN the system SHALL display time series visualization with trend lines
3. WHEN the data contains missing timestamps THEN the system SHALL provide options to handle gaps (interpolation, forward fill, or exclusion)
4. IF the time series has irregular intervals THEN the system SHALL offer resampling options (daily, weekly, monthly aggregation)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to apply different forecasting algorithms to my time series data, so that I can compare multiple approaches and select the most appropriate method for my use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects forecasting mode THEN the system SHALL provide at least three forecasting methods: Simple Moving Average, Exponential Smoothing, and Linear Trend
2. WHEN a forecasting method is selected THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of method-specific parameters (window size, smoothing factor, etc.)
3. WHEN forecasting is initiated THEN the system SHALL split data into training and validation sets automatically
4. IF the user specifies a custom train/test split THEN the system SHALL respect the user-defined split ratio

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a student learning forecasting techniques, I want to see real-time visualization of forecast results with confidence intervals, so that I can understand the uncertainty and accuracy of different methods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN forecasting completes THEN the system SHALL display historical data, fitted values, and future predictions on an interactive chart
2. WHEN displaying forecasts THEN the system SHALL show confidence intervals or prediction bounds where applicable
3. WHEN multiple methods are compared THEN the system SHALL overlay results on the same chart with different colors/styles
4. IF the forecast extends beyond available data THEN the system SHALL clearly distinguish between historical, fitted, and predicted values

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an analyst, I want to evaluate forecast accuracy using standard metrics, so that I can quantitatively assess model performance and make informed decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN forecasting is complete THEN the system SHALL calculate and display MAE (Mean Absolute Error), RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), and MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
2. WHEN validation data exists THEN the system SHALL compute accuracy metrics on the holdout set
3. WHEN comparing multiple methods THEN the system SHALL rank methods by accuracy metrics
4. IF seasonal patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL provide seasonal decomposition visualization

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user of NetCraft AI, I want to export forecasting results and save trained models, so that I can use the predictions in other applications and preserve my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN forecasting is complete THEN the system SHALL allow export of predictions as CSV with timestamps and confidence intervals
2. WHEN a user wants to save their work THEN the system SHALL serialize forecast models to JSON format for later loading
3. WHEN exporting results THEN the system SHALL include metadata about the forecasting method, parameters, and accuracy metrics
4. IF the user loads a saved forecast model THEN the system SHALL restore the complete forecasting configuration and allow new predictions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a new user, I want access to sample time series datasets and guided tutorials, so that I can quickly learn how to use the forecasting features effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the forecasting section THEN the system SHALL provide at least two demo datasets (e.g., sales data, temperature data)
2. WHEN demo data is loaded THEN the system SHALL pre-configure reasonable forecasting parameters as examples
3. WHEN a user is new to forecasting THEN the system SHALL provide tooltips and explanations for each forecasting method
4. IF a user requests help THEN the system SHALL display information about when to use each forecasting technique
