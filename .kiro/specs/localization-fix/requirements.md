# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The NetCraft AI application's internationalization system is completely broken, showing translation keys instead of actual translated text throughout the interface. This critical issue prevents users from properly using the application in both English and Ukrainian languages. The system needs immediate diagnosis and repair to restore proper localization functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see actual translated text instead of translation keys, so that I can understand and use the application interface properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display actual English text instead of translation keys like "navigation.data"
2. WHEN a user switches to Ukrainian THEN the system SHALL display actual Ukrainian text instead of translation keys
3. WHEN translation loading fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to English text instead of showing raw keys
4. WHEN a translation key is missing THEN the system SHALL show the English fallback or a meaningful default instead of the key path

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the i18n system to properly initialize and load translations, so that the translation functions work correctly throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL successfully initialize i18next with all required configurations
2. WHEN translation namespaces are loaded THEN the system SHALL properly register them with i18next
3. WHEN useTranslation hook is called THEN the system SHALL return working translation functions
4. WHEN translation resources are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback behavior

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the language toggle to work properly, so that I can switch between English and Ukrainian languages successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the language toggle THEN the system SHALL immediately switch all visible text to the selected language
2. WHEN I switch languages THEN the system SHALL persist my preference and restore it on page reload
3. WHEN language switching occurs THEN the system SHALL update the HTML lang attribute correctly
4. WHEN language switching fails THEN the system SHALL show an error message and maintain the current language

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and debugging capabilities, so that I can quickly identify and fix translation issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN translation loading fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error messages to the console
2. WHEN a translation key is missing THEN the system SHALL log the missing key in development mode
3. WHEN i18n initialization fails THEN the system SHALL provide a clear error message and fallback behavior
4. WHEN namespace loading fails THEN the system SHALL retry with fallback strategies

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want all existing translation content to be preserved and working, so that no translated text is lost during the fix.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the fix is applied THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing English translations
2. WHEN the fix is applied THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing Ukrainian translations
3. WHEN the fix is applied THEN the system SHALL preserve all technical terms and formatting
4. WHEN the fix is applied THEN the system SHALL maintain namespace organization and structure
