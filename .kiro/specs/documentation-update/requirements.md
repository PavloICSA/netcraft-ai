# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves updating NetCraft AI's documentation, guidelines, and landing pages to accurately reflect the newly added Random Forest and Time Series Forecasting capabilities. The current documentation only mentions neural networks and clustering, but the application now includes four major ML capabilities that need to be properly documented and showcased.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user visiting the landing page, I want to see all available ML capabilities clearly presented, so that I understand the full scope of NetCraft AI's functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the landing page THEN the system SHALL display all four ML capabilities: Neural Networks, Random Forest, Clustering, and Time Series Forecasting
2. WHEN a user views the hero section THEN the system SHALL include updated taglines that mention all capabilities
3. WHEN a user scrolls through features THEN the system SHALL show feature cards for all four ML methods
4. WHEN a user views the footer navigation THEN the system SHALL include links to all capability pages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer reading the steering guidelines, I want accurate information about the project structure and features, so that I can understand how to work with the codebase effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing product.md THEN the system SHALL list Random Forest and Time Series Forecasting in core features
2. WHEN reviewing structure.md THEN the system SHALL include Forecasting components and random-forest lib directories
3. WHEN reviewing structure.md THEN the system SHALL update the component organization to reflect new feature domains
4. WHEN reviewing tech.md THEN the system SHALL maintain accuracy about the technology stack used

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user reading the About page, I want comprehensive information about all available features, so that I can understand the platform's full capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the About page THEN the system SHALL describe all four ML capabilities in the features section
2. WHEN a user reads the mission statement THEN the system SHALL include forecasting and ensemble methods in the description
3. WHEN a user views feature details THEN the system SHALL provide specific information about Random Forest and Time Series algorithms
4. WHEN a user reads the technology section THEN the system SHALL accurately reflect the current implementation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user exploring the demo carousel, I want to see examples of all available ML methods, so that I can understand what each capability offers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the demo carousel THEN the system SHALL include slides for Random Forest prediction
2. WHEN a user views the demo carousel THEN the system SHALL include slides for Time Series Forecasting
3. WHEN a user navigates through demos THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent styling and information quality
4. WHEN a user clicks demo links THEN the system SHALL navigate to the appropriate feature pages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user navigating the application, I want consistent terminology and descriptions across all pages, so that I have a coherent understanding of the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing descriptions across pages THEN the system SHALL use consistent terminology for each ML method
2. WHEN reading feature descriptions THEN the system SHALL maintain the same level of detail and technical accuracy
3. WHEN viewing navigation elements THEN the system SHALL use consistent naming conventions
4. WHEN reading capability descriptions THEN the system SHALL accurately reflect the implemented algorithms and features
