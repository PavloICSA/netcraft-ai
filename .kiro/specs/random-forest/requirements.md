# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds Random Forest algorithm support to NetCraft AI, expanding the prediction capabilities beyond neural networks. Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to create robust predictions with built-in feature importance analysis. This addition will provide users with an alternative machine learning approach that's often more interpretable and requires less hyperparameter tuning than neural networks.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to train Random Forest models on my CSV data, so that I can get accurate predictions with ensemble learning methods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads CSV data THEN the system SHALL provide Random Forest as a prediction algorithm option alongside neural networks
2. WHEN a user selects Random Forest THEN the system SHALL display configuration options for number of trees, max depth, and minimum samples per leaf
3. WHEN a user trains a Random Forest model THEN the system SHALL show real-time training progress with tree construction status
4. WHEN training completes THEN the system SHALL display model accuracy metrics including out-of-bag error and feature importance scores

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to configure Random Forest hyperparameters, so that I can optimize the model for my specific dataset characteristics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring Random Forest THEN the system SHALL provide input fields for number of trees (default 100, range 10-500)
2. WHEN configuring Random Forest THEN the system SHALL provide input fields for maximum tree depth (default auto, range 1-50)
3. WHEN configuring Random Forest THEN the system SHALL provide input fields for minimum samples per leaf (default 1, range 1-20)
4. WHEN configuring Random Forest THEN the system SHALL provide input fields for feature sampling ratio (default sqrt, options: sqrt, log2, all)
5. IF invalid hyperparameters are entered THEN the system SHALL display validation errors with suggested valid ranges

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see feature importance analysis from Random Forest, so that I can understand which variables most influence my predictions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Random Forest training completes THEN the system SHALL calculate and display feature importance scores for all input variables
2. WHEN displaying feature importance THEN the system SHALL show a horizontal bar chart with features ranked by importance
3. WHEN displaying feature importance THEN the system SHALL show numerical importance values with percentages
4. WHEN hovering over feature importance bars THEN the system SHALL display detailed tooltips with exact values

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to make predictions with trained Random Forest models, so that I can apply the model to new data points.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Random Forest model is trained THEN the system SHALL provide a prediction interface for entering new data values
2. WHEN making predictions THEN the system SHALL display the predicted value with confidence intervals
3. WHEN making predictions THEN the system SHALL show individual tree votes for transparency
4. WHEN making batch predictions THEN the system SHALL support CSV upload for multiple predictions at once

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a student, I want to visualize Random Forest decision boundaries, so that I can understand how the ensemble method works.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN working with 2D datasets THEN the system SHALL display decision boundary visualization for Random Forest
2. WHEN displaying decision boundaries THEN the system SHALL show individual tree boundaries with different colors/opacity
3. WHEN displaying decision boundaries THEN the system SHALL show the final ensemble boundary prominently
4. WHEN interacting with the visualization THEN the system SHALL allow toggling individual tree visibility

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a machine learning practitioner, I want to save and load Random Forest models, so that I can reuse trained models across sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Random Forest model is trained THEN the system SHALL provide export functionality to save the model as JSON
2. WHEN exporting Random Forest models THEN the system SHALL include all tree structures, hyperparameters, and feature metadata
3. WHEN importing Random Forest models THEN the system SHALL validate the model format and restore full functionality
4. WHEN loading saved models THEN the system SHALL restore all prediction capabilities and feature importance analysis

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to compare Random Forest performance with neural networks, so that I can choose the best algorithm for my data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN both Random Forest and neural network models are trained on the same dataset THEN the system SHALL provide a comparison view
2. WHEN comparing models THEN the system SHALL display accuracy metrics side-by-side (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
3. WHEN comparing models THEN the system SHALL show training time and prediction speed comparisons
4. WHEN comparing models THEN the system SHALL highlight the better-performing model for each metric

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Random Forest implementation to follow the same patterns as existing algorithms, so that the codebase remains maintainable and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing Random Forest THEN the system SHALL follow the same TypeScript patterns used in neural network implementation
