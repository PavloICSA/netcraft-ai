# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Project Setup





  - Create folder `src/lib/random-forest/` with basic file structure
  - Define TypeScript interfaces in `src/types.d.ts`: RandomForestConfig, DecisionTreeNode, RandomForestModel
  - Create placeholder exports in `index.ts`, `RandomForest.ts`, `DecisionTree.ts`
  - _Requirements: 8.1, 8.4_

- [x] 2. Decision Tree Implementation





  - Implement simple CART decision tree with Gini impurity (classification) and MSE (regression)
  - Add recursive splitting with configurable max depth and min samples per leaf
  - Create prediction function for tree traversal and leaf value return
  - Write unit test to verify predictions on small synthetic dataset
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 8.1, 8.3_

- [x] 3. Random Forest Ensemble





  - Build ensemble that creates N trees using bootstrap sampling
  - Implement feature subsampling at each split (sqrt, log2, all options)
  - Add prediction aggregation: majority vote for classification, mean average for regression
  - Include optional vote confidence calculation based on tree agreement
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 2.4, 4.2, 8.1_

- [x] 4. UI Components





- [x] 4.1 Create RandomForestForm component


  - Build form with inputs for nTrees, maxDepth, minSamplesLeaf, featureRatio
  - Add input validation with appropriate ranges and required field checking
  - Style with Tailwind CSS and ensure responsive layout
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 8.2_

- [x] 4.2 Create RandomForestResults component

  - Display performance metrics: accuracy, RÂ², MSE, and training time
  - Add interface for inputting new samples and getting predictions
  - Include simple feature importance chart using existing chart components
  - Style with Tailwind CSS for consistent layout
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 3.1, 3.2, 4.1, 8.2_

- [x] 5. Integration with Predictor





  - Add Random Forest as algorithm option in existing predictor module
  - Enable single sample prediction and batch CSV prediction workflows
  - Route to RandomForestResults page and integrate with existing navigation
  - Test complete workflow from algorithm selection to results display
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 4.4, 8.2, 8.5_

- [ ] 6. Optional Enhancements
- [ ] 6.1 Model serialization and persistence
  - Implement JSON serialization/deserialization for trained Random Forest models
  - Add save/load functionality consistent with existing model persistence patterns
  - Test model export and import roundtrip accuracy
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4_

- [ ] 6.2 Error handling and testing
  - Add basic error handling for invalid inputs and edge cases
  - Create minimal unit tests for tree building and ensemble prediction correctness
  - Implement user-friendly error messages and input validation feedback
  - _Requirements: 2.5, 8.1, 8.3_
