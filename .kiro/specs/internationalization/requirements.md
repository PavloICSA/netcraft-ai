# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements comprehensive bilingual support for the NetCraft AI React application, enabling users to switch between English (default) and Ukrainian languages. The implementation will use react-i18next for internationalization, provide proper locale-aware formatting, maintain accessibility standards, and preserve technical terminology while translating user-facing content.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to switch between English and Ukrainian languages instantly, so that I can use the application in my preferred language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display content in English by default
2. WHEN a user clicks the language toggle button THEN the system SHALL instantly switch all user-facing text to the selected language
3. WHEN a user switches languages THEN the system SHALL persist the language preference in localStorage
4. WHEN a user reloads the page THEN the system SHALL restore their previously selected language preference
5. WHEN no language preference exists THEN the system SHALL detect browser language but default to English if Ukrainian is not detected

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want all user interface elements to be properly translated, so that I can understand and navigate the application effectively in Ukrainian.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Ukrainian is selected THEN the system SHALL translate all buttons, labels, placeholders, tooltips, form helper text, validation errors, menu items, breadcrumbs, table headers, modal dialogs, toasts, and notifications
2. WHEN Ukrainian is selected THEN the system SHALL translate landing page marketing copy, About, Contact, Guidelines pages, and in-app guidance
3. WHEN Ukrainian is selected THEN the system SHALL translate error messages and user guidance while keeping programmatic error codes unchanged
4. WHEN Ukrainian is selected THEN the system SHALL provide translated legal page content skeleton with clear placeholders for legal review

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want technical terminology and metric abbreviations to remain unchanged, so that I can maintain consistency with international standards and documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is translated THEN the system SHALL preserve statistical abbreviations (RMSE, MSE, MAE, MAPE, RÂ², AUC, F1, Precision, Recall) unchanged
2. WHEN content is translated THEN the system SHALL preserve algorithm and model names (Random Forest, K-means, SOM, ANN, LSTM, PCA, DBSCAN, t-SNE, UMAP, Decision Tree, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression) unchanged
3. WHEN content is translated THEN the system SHALL preserve dataset names, demo names, and CSV filenames unchanged
4. WHEN content is translated THEN the system SHALL preserve file names, code snippets, config keys, and inline code blocks unchanged
5. WHEN content is translated THEN the system SHALL preserve units, abbreviations, brand names, and trademarks unchanged
6. WHEN translating metric descriptions THEN the system SHALL translate explanatory text but keep abbreviations in parentheses unchanged

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Ukrainian user, I want dates, numbers, and currencies to be formatted according to Ukrainian locale standards, so that the information is presented in a familiar format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Ukrainian is selected THEN the system SHALL format dates using uk-UA locale standards
2. WHEN Ukrainian is selected THEN the system SHALL format numbers using uk-UA locale standards with appropriate thousand separators
3. WHEN displaying charts and tooltips THEN the system SHALL use locale-appropriate number formatting for axis ticks and tooltip values
4. WHEN parsing CSV imports THEN the system SHALL handle dates robustly but present them formatted to the current locale in the UI

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the language switching feature to be fully accessible, so that I can use it with screen readers and keyboard navigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the language toggle is rendered THEN the system SHALL provide proper aria-pressed attributes and keyboard accessibility
2. WHEN a user changes language THEN the system SHALL update the HTML lang attribute accordingly
3. WHEN a user changes language THEN the system SHALL announce the language change to screen readers
4. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL set the correct language attribute on the HTML element

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want type-safe translation keys and comprehensive tooling, so that I can maintain translation quality and catch missing translations during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing translations THEN the system SHALL provide TypeScript-safe translation key types
2. WHEN translations are added or modified THEN the system SHALL support namespaced organization (common, landing, data, predictor, clusterizer, forecasting, results, forms, legal, errors, guides)
3. WHEN translations are managed THEN the system SHALL support pluralization and interpolation with safe escaping
4. WHEN developing THEN the system SHALL provide a translation coverage report script that identifies missing keys
5. WHEN translations are updated THEN the system SHALL provide a CSV export for translator handoff

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a translator, I want clear guidelines and structured translation files, so that I can efficiently translate content while preserving technical accuracy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN translation files are provided THEN the system SHALL organize translations in logical namespaces with hierarchical keys
2. WHEN translation files are provided THEN the system SHALL use interpolation tokens instead of string concatenation
3. WHEN translation files are provided THEN the system SHALL support plural forms with proper Ukrainian pluralization rules
4. WHEN translation files are provided THEN the system SHALL include clear documentation of terms that must not be translated
5. WHEN translation files are provided THEN the system SHALL provide English source files as canonical reference

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a quality assurance tester, I want comprehensive testing capabilities, so that I can verify translation completeness and functionality across different scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing the application THEN the system SHALL provide automated tests for default English language rendering
2. WHEN testing language switching THEN the system SHALL provide tests that verify UI elements change to Ukrainian
3. WHEN testing technical preservation THEN the system SHALL provide tests that verify metric labels and algorithm names remain unchanged
4. WHEN testing locale formatting THEN the system SHALL provide tests that verify date and number formatting changes to uk-UA standards
5. WHEN testing persistence THEN the system SHALL provide tests that verify language preference persists across page reloads
